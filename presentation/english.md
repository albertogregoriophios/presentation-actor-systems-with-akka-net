# Actor Model

What is an Actor?
History of the actor model

----

### Actors are..

- everything ðŸ¦„ (Everything is an actor)
- lightweight
- stateful

----

### Actors can..

- receive messages 
 - process sequentially
- change internal state
- send new messages
- span children

----

### Location transparency

- Actor References instead of direct communication
- Communication only via messages (that can be routed)
- Dead letter concept
- Actors can be located in the same machine or in a different country

---

# Akka.net

- repository stats

----

- Actor Model
- Lightweight event-driven processes (1M+ actors per GB)
- Message-based Communication
- 

----

Simple and high-level abstractions for concurrency and parallelism

----

### Let it crash

- Supervisor hierarchy
- Self restoring
- Persistency/Journaling

----

## Where does Akka.net comes from

- Scala (JVM)
- Akka 
  - add stats

----

## Basic Actors

- Untyped
- Typed

----

### States

- Become/Unbecome (stack state)


----

## Routers

----

## Remote

- Akka.Remote

-----

## Overview of other capabilities

- Akka.Cluster
- Akka.Persistence
- Akka.Streams

----

## Akka.net Pros

- Resilient
- Scalable
- Very performant

----

## Akka.net Cons

- Not so easy to get started
- Yet another abstraction
- Complex distributed logic is still complex

----
